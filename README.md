Our custom fork of pKVM based on the Android tree

What currently works, execute the following make targets in order:

* `make tools`

* `make host-kernel`

* `make ubuntu-template`. This creates an Ubuntu system that is reused by the
  hostimage and guestimae targets.

* `make target-crosvm`

* `make hostimage`

* `make guest-kernel`

* `make guestimage`

* `make guestimage2`. This is optional. It provides a second guest image with different IP address and hostname. It depends on the guestimage target.

* `make guestimage3`. This is optional. It provides a third guest image with different IP address and hostname. It depends on the guestimage target.

* `make guestimage4`. This is optional. It provides a fourth guest image with different IP address and hostname. It depends on the guestimage target.

* `make DEBUGGER=1 run`. This will boot the pkvm host image with the host kernel in qemu with the gdb server enabled.

* `make gdb`. This will start the gdb and connect it to the qemu gdb server. This should be executed in another terminal window.

The `make host-kernel` and `make target-crosvm` targets can be executed in any order, there is no dependency between them. Also `make guestkernel` only needs depend on `make tools`, while `make guestimage` depends on `make guestkernel`

The default user is `ubuntu`. No password is required. The hostimage has a script, `run-crosvm.sh`, which can be used to run the guestimage with crosvm, also doing the necessary configuration of networking.

There is also a `make all` target that will build everything in the right order. However, it will only build the first guestimage. If the additional guest images are wanted, then they must be built by adding an extra `make guestimage2', `make guestimage3`, or `make guestimage4`.

What is missing:

* The builds are not necessarily 100% reliable.

* Building has only been tested on Ubuntu 22.04.

* The build dependencies are not fully analyzed. On ubuntu 22.04, you can try installing the following:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
